# CYX GUI

This repository now contains a browser-based GUI app (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open:

- http://localhost:4173

## What was fixed

- Added missing GUI implementation files.
- Added client-side validation to prevent empty tasks.
- Added add/remove interactions so the UI is fully functional.
